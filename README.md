### Data Analysis of U.S. Representatives' Stock Trades

This is a work in progress project that uses data from members of the U.S. House of Representatives' stock transactions. This initial report dives into some basic cleaning and EDA, univariate and bivariate analyses, missingness testing, and a hypothesis test on an interesting question: are reps from the state of Michigan better traders?

Current deliverable:
- Check the `final_report.pdf` for a summary of our findings.

Expect these soon:
- Added features, specifically the party of a representative. This will allow us to run some interesting analyses based on party
- ML modeling
